Here, i've provided the solutions for the assignment1 in the form of code snippets named as Question1 to Question9 

•	Here in Question1, I’ve used python in-built functions such as append() ,min(),max(),sort() to sort the list and to find out the maximum and minimum as well as appending some new elements to the list.
•	To find the median of the list I’ve provided some logic with the help of if-else loop, and I’ve given the average of the list by using in-built functions such as sum(), len()
•	And to find the range I’ve used max() and min() functions by extracting the difference between them.


•	Here in Question2, created a empty dictionary named dog and added key-value pairs and printed it on the console. 
•	I’ve created another dict named student and added necessary key-value pairs and done some operations such as adding some extra elements in the skillset and finding what type it is and also extracting only keys and values separately from the dictionary.


•	Here in Question3, I’ve declared 2 tuples and added them with the help of concatenation operator “+” and assigned it to another tuple “Siblings” and printed it on the console and also modified the existing siblings tuple by adding two other elements and printed it.


•	Here in Question4, declared a set and finding the length of the set and adding new elements to the set and also performing various set operations between the sets and at last converting the list to set and comparing the both.


•	Here in Question5, we are taking the input (radius) from the user and finding the are and circumference of the circle


Here in Question6, we’re splitting the given sentence into words with the help of a pre-defined function which is split() and converting that into a set so it has only unique words and atlast counting all the unique elements.

Here in Question7 , we are using escape sequences to get the desired output as per the given document.

Here in Question8, we are using placeholders such as %d for integers for the output to get as mentioned in the document.

Here in Question9, we are taking the input from the user and storing it in the list and traversing the list with the help of for loop and converting the lbs to kgs and again appending them to the list with the help of for loop and printing it.
